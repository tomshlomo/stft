function [x, k] = istft(S, window, hop, symFlag)
% Inverse Short Time Fourier Transform in the least squares sense.
% Given an STFT array S, this function finds x such that
% norm( S - stft(x, window, hop, size(S,1)) , 'fro' )
% is minimized.
% 
% The algorithm is based on [1].
% The implementation is fully vectorized and supports multichannel signals.
%
%
% Inputs:
%   S - STFT array, with frequency along rows and time across columns.
%       If size(S,3) > 1, the ISTFT is performed independently on each layer.
%   window - a vector containing the window function.
%   hop - a positive integer describing the hop size.
%   symFlag (optional) - frequency symmetry type, specified as 'nonsymmetric' (default) or 'symmetric'. Same as symFlag of MATLAB's built-in ifft.
%                        Set as 'symmetric' if x is expected to be real.
% Outputs:
%   x - a time domain signal. For 3D S, the the i'th column of x if the ISTFT of S(:,:,i).
%   k - a scalar describing the instability of the inverse transform. It depends only on the window and hop size.
%       The minimum value is 1, which means the most stable. 
%       k=1 is achived for windows whos square value satisfy the COLA (Constant Overlap Add) condition.

%% Weighted overlap add

% the reshape above usually does nothing, but it is necessary in the case
% that L2==hop, since then J is a row vector, and therefore according to
% MATLAB's weird slicing rules, window(J) is a column vector.
